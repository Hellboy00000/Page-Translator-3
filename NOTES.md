# Testing checklist
```
web-ext run -v -f "C:\Program Files\Firefox Developer Edition\firefox.exe" --start-url "https://www.mozilla.org/sv-SE/contribute/" --start-url "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"
```
- [ ] Default options, see icon, clicking translates, icon not present, go back, icon present
- [ ] Wikipedia, icon not present
- [ ] Ctrl-N, Ctrl-Shift-A, navigate to extension options
- [ ] Toggle Always show -> icon appears/disappears in Wikipedia, stays in Mozilla
- [ ] Always translate, Mozilla gets translated instantly. Toggling produces no further change.
- [ ] Turn off auto translate, turn on always show, test that auto translate still translates
- [ ] Change translator to Microsoft, go back on Mozilla, see that it translates w/ Microsoft

## Android

```
web-ext run --target=firefox-android --android-device=HSMDU17228001108
```

# Determining whether to show the icon or not

As of HTML5, the proper way to declare the language for a page is the `lang` property on the `html` element. Example: `<html lang="en">`

There were many inconsistent methods prior to HTML5, like a `meta` tag for `Content-Language`. Because determining the page language from these methods is error prone, we assume it's foreign if it's not using HTML5 or later. Also, while `Content-Language` often is sent as a HTTP header for the page, but headers for the page are not accessible to JavaScript running on the page.

`navigator.languages` returns an array of languages the user has told the browser to request from servers. 

Display the translate icon:

1. If the user has set the option to always display it
2. If the page does not properly specify a language in markup
3. If the page does specify a language and it does not match any of `navigator.languages` explicitly or partially with BCP 47 / IANA Language Subtag Registry primary language subtag

# Re-do pageIsInForeignLanguage()

Firefox for Android doesn't have the browser.tabs.detectLanguage()

Add tests for language matching logic
- page's language: missing, sv, sv-SV, en-SV, SV-SV, EN-SV
- browser: en, en-US, sp, sp-US


# ADO submission

Summary:
Translate any page inline using Google Translate or Microsoft Translator. A translate icon will appear in the address bar when a page is detected to be in a foreign language. Keeps your UI minimal.

Notes to Reviewer: 
The translate page action will only appear on pages detected to be in a language not in your browser's preferred language list (about:preferences#content Languages), unless you override the detection in the add-on's options. On Android, it will always be displayed because browser.tabs.detectLanguage is not available in Firefox for Android.
